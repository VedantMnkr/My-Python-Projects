# Snake Game 🐍
```
Though I named it classic but it is not that classic at all.
This game i developed as part of my internship project.
Where they needed some graphical medium to operate human arm actions using Computer Vision.

Here we can control:
  - Where the food spawns (in particular range of region)
  - Guided lines to easily aling snake with the food.
  - And the random elements are not that random.
