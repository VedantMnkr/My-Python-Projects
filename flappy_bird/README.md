CC: CODING WITH RUSS on youtube

I developed this one too as part of my internship project and serving as graphical medium for out CV counterpart.

This one also has some modification compared to the original flappy bird game.
    - The cordinates are directly influenced by input. The old bouncing mechanism is removed.
    - The pipe generation is controlled and systematic i.e.
          • The gap between upper and lower pipe
          • The distance between two adjacent pipes
          • Stepping length of pipes
          • and limitaions
    - Added an entity (Bugga) for bonus purpose
    - The Bird has lives
    - The game restarts when all the lives are gone
    - If the bird died and has lives, the game will start where from where it left.
